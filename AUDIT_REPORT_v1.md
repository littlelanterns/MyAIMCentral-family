## 0 — Methodology and tool health at audit time

### Stage execution order (approved 2026-04-18)

**Stage A — Groundwork** (serial; AURI kicks off as shell background job after first-call OAuth)
1. Scope 1 pre-flight — `tsc -b`, `npm run lint`, tool-health re-verification, mgrep spot-check
2. AURI retroactive scan kicks off as long-running background job (priority PRD-01, PRD-02, PRD-05, Edge Functions)
3. Scope 5 — Stub registry reconciliation

**Stage B — Beta Readiness infrastructure** (binary checks)
4. Scope 8a — binary compliance/safety checklist

**Stage C — Main body** (integration tracing)
5. Scope 2 — PRD-to-code alignment (batched Foundation → LiLa → Personal Growth → Tasks/Studio → Dashboards/Calendar → Communication → Vault/BookShelf → Gamification → Compliance)
6. Scope 3 + Scope 8b — merged integration traversal; findings tagged `SCOPE-3` or `SCOPE-8b` at emission time
7. Scope 4 — Cost optimization P1–P9

**Stage D — Reporting and measurement**
8. Scope 6 — LiLa content discrepancy (reporting-only; feeds `LILA_KNOWLEDGE_BACKLOG.md`)
9. Scope 7 — Performance baseline (feeds `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`)

### Tool health at audit start (2026-04-18)

| Tool | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tsc -b` | Clean (exit 0) | No TypeScript errors |
| `npm run lint` | Clean (exit 0, 72 warnings) | All 72 warnings are `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`; conventions.md sets this rule to warn-level intentionally |
| `./node_modules/.bin/tsc` | Present | Hygiene check passed (see CLAUDE.md silent-failure pattern #4) |
| codegraph MCP | ✓ Connected; green | Re-indexed 2026-04-16 per TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT |
| mgrep CLI | ✓ Auth valid; watch running | Scale tier; per TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT F10, wizards directory may still have embedding lag. Spot-check pending Stage A resumption. |
| endor-cli-tools MCP (AURI) | ✓ Connected at user scope (re-registered 2026-04-18) | Tools not yet exposed in this session; first-call browser OAuth pending next session |
| Supabase CLI | Green (cloud mode) | Per TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT |
| Vercel CLI | Green (`lilacrew`) | Per TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT |

## 1 — Scope 1: Code quality

### [SCOPE-1.F1] TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT_2026-04-16 F1 AURI recipe is wrong for Developer Edition

- **Severity:** Medium (documentation defect — misleads future reinstall attempts)
- **Location:** [TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT_2026-04-16.md](TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT_2026-04-16.md) F1 "Reinstall recipe" (line 324 area); [claude/LESSONS_LEARNED.md](claude/LESSONS_LEARNED.md) (pending entry)
- **Description:** F1's recipe directs `endorctl init` as step 1. Research in a parallel Claude.ai session (2026-04-18) confirmed `endorctl init` routes to the Enterprise Edition flow — it prompts for a tenant namespace which this project does not have and does not want. Developer Edition (the correct target for solo use, free, local-only scanning) uses a different flow: no `endorctl init`, no tenant, no namespace. First-call browser OAuth is handled by the MCP server itself on first tool invocation inside Claude Code.
- **Evidence:** (1) Tenise's prior `endorctl init` attempt was aborted at the tenant namespace prompt. (2) Endor's official Claude Code MCP setup doc (https://docs.endorlabs.com/setup-deployment/mcp/claude-code) documents the Developer Edition flow without `endorctl init`. (3) `.endorctl\config.yaml` verified absent in `USERPROFILE` — aborted init did not write partial auth state.
- **Proposed resolution:** **Intentional-Update-Doc.** Rewrite TOOL_HEALTH_REPORT_2026-04-16.md F1 with the corrected Developer Edition recipe (register MCP at user scope with full binary path → first-call OAuth in new session). Add a matching entry to `claude/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` under the existing "documented tool recipes that turned out to be wrong" theme (alongside the Go-npm shim issue and the mgrep token issue).
- **Founder decision required:** N (already founder-driven correction)
- **Wizard Design Impact:** N/A
- **Beta Readiness flag:** N

### [SCOPE-1.F2] tsc -b and npm run lint baseline at audit start

- **Severity:** Low (informational baseline)
- **Location:** Whole repo
- **Description:** `tsc -b` exits 0 with no errors. `npm run lint` exits 0 with 72 warnings, all `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. Per `claude/conventions.md`, the ESLint config is an allow-list and exhaustive-deps is intentionally warn-level (too many false positives to make it an error). No lint errors. No hard block on audit or future builds.
- **Evidence:** Background Bash tasks `bzoxqywpi` (tsc) and `bjp2t50bz` (lint) both exited 0. Representative warning locations: `Studio.tsx:458`, `Tasks.tsx:175,522`, `MemberArchiveDetail.tsx:513,716,717`.
- **Proposed resolution:** **Informational.** The 72 exhaustive-deps warnings are candidates for tech-debt review if the project later decides to tighten the rule to error-level. Not itself a finding requiring action.
- **Founder decision required:** N
- **Wizard Design Impact:** N/A
- **Beta Readiness flag:** N

### [SCOPE-1.F3] AURI retroactive scan blocked on first-call OAuth in fresh session

- **Severity:** High (Scope 1 sub-check explicitly required by gameplan line 298)
- **Location:** Whole repo; priority PRD-01 (Auth) / PRD-02 (Permissions) / PRD-05 (LiLa system prompts + ethics) / Edge Functions with AI calls or user data
- **Description:** Gameplan Scope 1 requires an AURI retroactive scan to surface security issues not caught during original build (AURI was non-functional from install through 2026-04-16). AURI was re-registered at user scope on 2026-04-18 via the corrected Developer Edition recipe. The MCP server reports `✓ Connected` in `claude mcp list`, but the current session's tool surface does not expose `mcp__endor-cli-tools__*` tools (ToolSearch for "endor", "endor-cli-tools", "vulnerability scan" all return zero deferred tools). This is the canonical "Connected ≠ Functional" pattern documented in `claude/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`. Smoke test (lodash 4.17.20 vulnerability check) requires a fresh Claude Code session so the tool surface rebuilds against the updated user-scope registration.
- **Evidence:** `ToolSearch` returned "No matching deferred tools found" for three separate query forms against the endor namespace in this session. `claude mcp list` confirms connection at user scope. `~/.claude.json` top-level `mcpServers` contains the correct shape: `{"type":"stdio","command":"C:/Users/tenis/AppData/Roaming/npm/bin/endorctl.exe","args":["ai-tools","mcp-server"],"env":{}}`.
- **Proposed resolution:** Handoff to fresh session. Tenise drives first-call browser OAuth via Endor's documented smoke-test prompt. After smoke test returns real vulnerability data, Stage A resumes and AURI retroactive scan kicks off at minute one. Classification TBD — currently an in-flight Stage A step, not yet a defect.
- **Founder decision required:** N (planned handoff)
- **Wizard Design Impact:** N/A
- **Beta Readiness flag:** **Y** — AURI scan findings will feed `COMPLIANCE_READINESS_REPORT.md`
