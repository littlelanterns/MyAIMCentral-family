## Studio → Feature Wiring

| Studio Action | Target | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Customize] Task types (task/routine/opportunity) | TaskCreationModal | **Wired** | Opens modal pre-configured for type |
| [Customize] Sequential Collection | SequentialCreatorModal | **Wired** | PRD-09A/09B Studio Intelligence Phase 1 — previously silently broken (opened TaskCreationModal which created malformed rows). Now routes through `useCreateSequentialCollection`. |
| [Customize] List types | Navigate /lists?create=type | **Wired** | URL param auto-opens create modal |
| [Customize] Randomizer | Navigate /lists?create=randomizer | **Wired** | Studio URL path; also accessible directly via Lists page [+ New List] picker as of Phase 1 |
| [Customize] Guided Forms | GuidedFormAssignModal | **Wired** | Opens 2-step assign flow |
| [Customize] Trackers/Widgets | WidgetPicker + WidgetConfiguration | **Wired** | PRD-10 Phase A |
| My Customized: Deploy | TaskCreationModal | **Wired** | Opens modal from template |
| My Customized: Edit | TaskCreationModal | **Wired** | Opens modal for editing |
| My Customized: Duplicate | RoutineDuplicateChooserDialog → RoutineDuplicateTemplateDialog \| RoutineDuplicateDialog | **Wired** | Worker ROUTINE-PROPAGATION (2026-04-25, c4): single duplicate entry point per Convention #255. Chooser asks "What would you like to do?" → "Copy and Customize" (independent template, lands in My Customized) or "Assign Additional Member" (existing deploy flow). Non-routines keep shallow-copy path. |
| My Customized: Archive | Supabase soft delete | **Wired** | Sets archived_at |

## Routine Deployment & Propagation (Worker ROUTINE-PROPAGATION, 2026-04-25)

| Capability | How It Works | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Schedule to start later" toggle | Toggle in TaskCreationModal routine SectionCard, off by default; on reveals date picker | **Wired** | c2. Persists to `recurrence_details.dtstart` JSONB. Toggle-off silently writes `familyToday` (Convention #257 compliant via `fetchFamilyToday`). |
| Advance-start gating on dashboard | `recurringTaskFilter` hides routines whose `recurrence_details.dtstart` is in the future | **Wired** | c1. Both RRULE and per-section-frequency code paths covered. |
| Master-template edit confirmation | When mom edits a master with 1+ active deployments, modal names every affected family member ("This will update 3 active routines: Ruthie, Mosiah, and Gideon.") | **Wired** | c3. `MasterTemplateEditConfirmationModal`. Pre-check fires from both `handleSave` and `handleSaveToStudio`. 0-deployment path silent (toast only). |
| Overlap detection — backstop | Postgres trigger `prevent_overlapping_routine_assignments` raises `exclusion_violation` on overlap | **Wired** | c2.5. Migration 100176. Replaces strict unique index `tasks_unique_active_routine_per_assignee` from migration 100152. |
| Overlap detection — application warm path | `detectRoutineOverlap` pre-checks before insert; `RoutineOverlapResolutionModal` surfaces when found | **Wired** | c2.5. Three options: Replace / Keep both, adjust dates / Cancel. "Open existing routine" deep link. |
| Date-range overlap rule | `(existing.dtstart <= new.end_date) AND (existing.end_date >= new.dtstart)` with NULL end_date = +infinity | **Wired** | c2.5. Pure predicate `dateRangesOverlap` exported separately for cross-feature reuse. |
| Sequential non-overlapping deployments | Same template, same assignee, non-overlapping date ranges allowed | **Wired** | c2.5 founder D5 rescope. Summer routine + fall routine for same kid both legitimate. |
| "Scheduled to start" badge on Studio | `ScheduledStartBadge` size=full next to type pill on My Customized cards when ANY active deployment has future dtstart | **Wired** | c5. `useCustomizedTemplates` query computes earliest future dtstart per template. |
| "Scheduled to start" badge on Tasks page | `ScheduledStartBadge` size=compact below task title in TaskCard for routines with future dtstart | **Wired** | c5. Theme tokens only. |
| Post-save toasts | RoutingToastProvider success toast on every routine-template save path | **Wired** | c6. Five distinct variants. Anti-panic UX. |
| Master-template propagation contract | `task_template_sections` and `task_template_steps` propagate live via `template_id` join. Task-level fields snapshot. Past `routine_step_completions` survive structural edits. | **Wired** | c8. Convention #259 added to CLAUDE.md. |
| Shared `cloneRoutineTemplate` utility | `src/lib/templates/cloneRoutineTemplate.ts` — pure deep-clone, no task row insert. Reused by `RoutineDuplicateDialog` (clone-and-deploy) and `RoutineDuplicateTemplateDialog` (clone-only). | **Wired** | c4. Founder D6 Thread 1 — utilities live under `src/lib/templates/` for cross-feature reuse by future Workers 2/3/4. |
| Shared template UI under `src/components/templates/` | ScheduledStartBadge, MasterTemplateEditConfirmationModal, RoutineOverlapResolutionModal, RoutineDuplicateChooserDialog, RoutineDuplicateTemplateDialog | **Wired** | c2.5/c3/c4/c5. Cross-feature reuse-ready. |
| Lists template propagation | List templates have NO deployment wiring | Stub | NEW-ZZ (worksheet row 205, 2026-04-25). Decisions doc: `claude/feature-decisions/Lists-Template-Deploy-Decisions-Needed.md`. Deferred to Worker 4 LISTS-TEMPLATE-DEPLOY. |
| Shared routines (is_shared=true) completion UX | Anyone-can-complete + completer-color rendering + allowance credit to actual completer | Stub | Deferred to Worker 2 SHARED-ROUTINES per founder D6 Thread 3. Handoff: `claude/feature-decisions/Shared-Assignment-Model-Worker-Handoff.md`. Worker 1 audited is_shared=true rows pass advance-start + overlap detection cleanly. |

## Routine Save Reliability (Worker ROUTINE-SAVE-FIX, 2026-04-26)

| Capability | How It Works | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `routine_step_completions.step_id` ON DELETE SET NULL | Migration 100177 brings the FK into compliance with Convention #259. Step deletion no longer fails when completions reference it; orphaned completions retain `step_id=NULL`. | **Wired** | c1. All consumer call sites (`TaskCard`, `RoutineStepChecklist`, `GuidedActiveTasksSection`) filter NULLs out of their `Set<string>` so orphans never produce false-positive checkmarks on live steps. `RoutineStepCompletion.step_id` widened to `string \| null`. |
| Save-handler error toast | `TaskCreationModal.handleSave`, `handleSaveToStudio`, and `handleEditConfirm` all wrap `onSave` in try/catch. On reject: `console.error('Routine save failed:', err)` + error-variant toast ("Couldn't save changes. Please try again or contact support.") + modal stays open. | **Wired** | c2. Replaces silent try/finally that swallowed every save throw. |
| `UndoToast` error variant | `variant: 'success' \| 'error'` on `UndoToast` and `RoutingToastProvider`. Error variant uses error-token border, AlertTriangle icon, role='alert' / aria-live='assertive', 10s default dwell (vs 5s for success). | **Wired** | c2. All existing call sites preserved by default `variant='success'`. |
| `update_routine_template_atomic` RPC | Migration 100178 adds a SECURITY DEFINER function that performs the entire routine-template rewrite (UPDATE template + DELETE old sections/steps + INSERT new sections/steps) inside a single transaction. RLS check inside enforces caller's family ownership. Returns `{section_count, step_count}` jsonb. | **Wired** | c3. Eliminates partial-commit risk that motivated the silent-save bug. |
| Single rewrite path across call sites | `createTaskFromData.ts` editingTemplateId branch and `Tasks.tsx:handleEditTask` both call the RPC. Frequency-rule normalization (mwf, t_th, custom day sort/dedupe) lives in `src/lib/templates/serializeRoutineSectionsForRpc.ts` so the SQL stays simple and the mapping is unit-testable. | **Wired** | c3. Replaces two divergent inline rewrite chains that diverged on error handling (one threw, one swallowed). |
| Routine edit error surfacing | `Tasks.tsx:handleEditTask` now throws on UPDATE-tasks failure (was `console.error + return`) and on RPC failure. The c2 catch block in `TaskCreationModal` surfaces both via the error toast. | **Wired** | c3. Mom always sees what happened — no more silent saves. |

## Sequential Collections (PRD-09A/09B Studio Intelligence Phase 1)

| Capability | Entry Point | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create from Studio | Studio → Sequential Collection [Customize] → SequentialCreatorModal | **Wired** | Phase 1 (2026-04-06). Before Phase 1 this opened TaskCreationModal and silently wrote a broken single-row task. |
| Create from Tasks → Sequential tab | Tasks → Sequential tab → [+ Create] → SequentialCreatorModal | **Wired** | Same modal as Studio. |
| Create from Lists page | Lists → [+ New List] → "Sequential Collection" tile → SequentialCreatorModal | **Wired** | Phase 1 cross-surface visibility — new entry point. |
| DB writes | `sequential_collections` row + N `tasks` rows with `task_type='sequential'`, `sequential_collection_id`, `sequential_position`, first `active_count` flagged `sequential_is_active=true` | **Wired** | Via `useCreateSequentialCollection` mutation. E2E verified in `tests/e2e/features/studio-intelligence-phase1.spec.ts`. |
| Visible on Tasks → Sequential tab | `<SequentialCollectionView>` renders expandable cards with progress, restart-for-another-student, archive | **Wired** | Revived from dead code in Phase 1. |
| Visible on Lists page | Inline tile in grid / list view with "Sequential" badge + `current_index/total_items` subtitle | **Wired** | Phase 1 dual access. Only shown on `filter='all'`. |
| Sequential detail view from Lists page | Back-button wrapper rendering `<SequentialCollectionCard>` | **Wired** | Phase 1 — uses exported `SequentialCollectionCard`. Card has its own expand/collapse. |
| `createTaskFromData` guard | Throws `Error` on `taskType='sequential'` | **Wired** | Prevents silent re-introduction of the broken path. |
| `TaskCreationModal` guard | Skips `initialTaskType='sequential'` with `console.warn` | **Wired** | Defensive layer above the guard. |
| Advancement modes (practice_count / mastery) | — | **Wired** | Build J (2026-04-06) |
| Linked routine steps — editor + persistence | — | **Wired** | Build J (2026-04-06) |
| Linked routine steps — dashboard rendering | RoutineStepChecklist expands inline with linked content from sequential/randomizer/task sources | **Wired** | GuidedActiveTasksSection + TaskCard. 2026-04-13. |
| `curriculum-parse` Edge Function | — | **Wired** | Build J (2026-04-06) |

## Studio Capability Tags (PRD-09A/09B Studio Intelligence Phase 1)

## Task Breaker AI (PRD-09A)

| Feature | How It Works | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text Mode — Quick | TaskCreationModal → TaskBreaker → `task-breaker` Edge Function (Haiku) → 3-5 subtasks | **Wired** | Family context + active task counts passed |
| Text Mode — Detailed | Same flow → 5-10 subtasks with descriptions | **Wired** | |
| Text Mode — Granular | Same flow → 10-20 micro-steps | **Wired** | |
| Subtask creation | Accepted subtasks → child `tasks` rows via `parent_task_id` | **Wired** | Created in `createTaskFromData` |
| Image Mode | Camera/upload → Sonnet vision → action steps as subtasks | **Wired** | Camera capture + file upload in TaskBreaker.tsx, multimodal message to task-breaker Edge Function (Sonnet when image, Haiku for text-only). 2026-04-13. |
| Standalone Modal | StandaloneTaskBreakerModal — type task name + description, break down, save parent+children | **Wired** | QuickTasks strip (Zap icon pill), also openable from AI Vault. 2026-04-13. |

| QuickTasks Strip | Zap icon pill → opens StandaloneTaskBreakerModal | **Wired** | Between Tasks and MindSweep in action order. 2026-04-13. |

## Task Rotation Advancement (PRD-09A)

| Feature | How It Works | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rotation config persistence | `createTaskFromData` writes `recurrence_details.rotation` JSONB + `task_assignments` with `rotation_position` + `is_active` when `rotationEnabled=true` | **Wired** | 2026-04-13. Members array, current_index, frequency, last_rotated_at all stored. |
| Rotation cron | `advance_task_rotations()` runs daily at 00:15 UTC via pg_cron. Finds tasks with elapsed rotation periods, bumps current_index (wrapping), flips is_active on assignments, updates assignee_id. | **Wired** | Migration 100133. Supports weekly, biweekly, monthly, custom (defaults to weekly). |
| Rotation UI | AssignmentSelector toggle + frequency dropdown (weekly/biweekly/monthly/custom) | **Wired** | Already existed — now the config actually persists. |

## Opportunity Claim Lock Expiration (PRD-09A)

| Feature | How It Works | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server-side cron | `expire_overdue_task_claims()` runs hourly via pg_cron, releases expired claims | **Wired** | Sets status='released', released=true |
| Client-side backup | `useExpireOverdueClaims` sweeps on page load | **Wired** | Belt-and-suspenders with server cron |

## List Victory Mode (PRD-09B)

| Feature | How It Works | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Victory mode selector | 4-option segmented control (None / Per item / All done / Both) in list detail header | **Wired** | Shopping + generic list views, owner/parent only |
| Per-item victories | Checking a flagged item → victory with source='list_item_completed', idempotent | **Wired** | Checks for existing victory before creating |
| List-level victories | Last unchecked item checked → victory with source='list_completed' | **Wired** | Debounced per session |
| Per-item flag toggle | Trophy icon on each item, toggleable by owner/parent | **Wired** | Auto-flags all items when switching to item_completed or both |
| Auto-flagging on mode change | Switching to item_completed/both bulk-sets all items' victory_flagged=true | **Wired** | Mom can unflag specific items |
| Default by list type | randomizer → 'item_completed', everything else → 'none' | **Wired** | Frontend default in useCreateList |
| Celebration banner | "All done! Victory recorded!" on list completion | **Wired** | Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds |
| victory_flagged column | Per-item boolean on list_items, default false | **Wired** | Migration 100102 |

## Painted Calendar / Pick Dates (Worker 5, 2026-04-27)

| Capability | How It Works | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Pick Dates" frequency option | New radio option in UniversalScheduler alongside One-time/Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly/Custom. Tap dates on a calendar grid. | **Wired** | Produces `schedule_type='painted'` SchedulerOutput with explicit `rdates`. |
| Per-date assignee mapping | When 2+ members assigned and Pick Dates active, each painted date gets member-color pill assignee buttons. | **Wired** | `PickDatesAssigneeEditor` component. `assignee_map` on SchedulerOutput. |
| Instantiation mode selector | "Each kid does their own" vs "Shared — anyone completes" segmented control. | **Wired** | `instantiation_mode` on SchedulerOutput. |
| Time-of-day window | Optional "Active from [time] to [time]" on painted schedules. | **Wired** | `active_start_time` / `active_end_time` on SchedulerOutput. |
| deed_firings table | Connector architecture event log. Stores `scheduled_occurrence_active` firings. | **Wired** | Migration 100180. Phase 3 inherits + adds contract evaluation. |
| Painted-day deed firing | Hourly Edge Function (`fire-painted-schedules`, cron :20) writes deed firings when painted days arrive per family timezone. | **Wired** | Idempotent via unique key. Convention #246 compliant. |
| lists.schedule_config | JSONB column for attaching painted/recurring schedules to lists. | **Wired** | Migration 100181. NULL = always active. |
| "Active today" badge on list cards | Display-only pill on Lists page grid/list views when a list has a schedule attached. Green "Active today" or gray "Scheduled". | **Wired** | No filtering/hiding — Phase 3 scope. |
| CalendarPreview painted mode | CalendarPreview day-click toggles painted dates (not RDATE/EXDATE) when `schedule_type='painted'`. | **Wired** | |
| `isDateActive()` helper | Checks if a specific date is active in any SchedulerOutput. Works for all schedule types. | **Wired** | Exported from `@/components/scheduling`. |
| Contract evaluation of deed firings | Phase 3 reads deed_firings and evaluates contracts → godmother dispatch | Stub | Phase 3 scope |
| List visibility gating by schedule | Lists hidden/filtered based on schedule active state | Stub | Phase 3 scope |
| Convert-to-recurrence detection | Detect weekly patterns in painted dates and offer RRULE conversion | Stub | Optional polish pass |

## Known Issues / TODO

- LiLa help button in GuidedFormFillView is a stub (PRD-05 dependency)
- Guided Form child fill view + mom review flow not tested end-to-end
- Quick Create "Send Request" falls back to Notepad until PRD-15 is built
